# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Loops With Arrays

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required section is **Reflection** (and the **Project Plan** if you complete the Advanced Level), but if you used a unit testing framework, also fill in the **Running the Unit Tests** section. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Running the Unit Tests (Basic and Intermediate Levels Only)

_(Instructions for how to install the unit testing framework and run the unit tests.)_

## Project Plan (Advanced Level Only)

_(Put your project plan here. It could be pseudocode, an outline-style development plan, etc. But whatever form you choose, it should be detailed enough that another developer could feasibly use it to implement your solution.)_

## Reflection

### Basic and Intermediate Levels Only

For a software developer, what are the benefits of good unit tests? Are there any drawbacks to writing unit tests?

unit tests are good for checking to see if the functions work as expected to and don't do stuff that they're not supposed to do. as far as writing unit tests, you might not be thinking of all the possible edge cases with unit tests that you write yourself

### Advanced Level Only

For the bar graphs, did you uses JS or CSS to add in the styling? Explain your choice.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using various JS methods instead of `for`/`while` loops?

_(Put your reflection answer here.)_
